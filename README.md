# New-GVMReport
Take CSV output from GVM / OpenVAS to create a report that doesn't look like hell from 1980. 

## TODO
* Would like to add parameters for Logos, maybe CSS color schemes, so it could be easily adapter for other users 
* I currently open the output (html file) and save as a PDF - would like to add the option to save as a PDF directly
* Validation on Report name to exclude chars that aren't allowed in paths
* Handle accepting several CSV's to be combined into one report
* Additional Optional param for Notes early in the report
